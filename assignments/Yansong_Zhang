# R scripts

# load libraries and data
library(mlbench)
library(magrittr)
library(ggplot2)
data(BostonHousing)

# view summary of the data
summary(BostonHousing)

# try to get linear model
fit <- lm(medv ~ ., data=BostonHousing)

# see summary to know more related data columns
summary(fit)

# RMSE function to test each model
rmse(fit$fitted.values, BostonHousing$medv)

# Final linear model with specific related parameters
fit <- lm(medv ~ . -age -indus, data=BostonHousing)

# function for generating plots diagram 
ggplot( aes(x=medv, y=fit.4$fitted.values), data=BostonHousing ) + geom_point() + coord_equal( ylim=c(0,70), xlim=c(0,70) ) + geom_abline( slope=1, intercept=0, color="red") + xlab( "medium home value") + ylab("Estimated medium value") + theme( plot.background = element_blank() )




2. When speaking of Machine Learning, there are two functions or algorithms involved. Describe and differentiate the algorithms from the function.

Regression and Classification

Regression : The output variable takes continuous values

Classification : The output variable takes class labels




3. RMSE and MAE
 - Why is RMSE preferrable to MAE?
RMSE gives a relatively high weight to large errors. It is most useful when large errors are particularly undesirable.

 - When is MAE better?
MAE is a more natural measure of average error, It measures accuracy for continuous variables
